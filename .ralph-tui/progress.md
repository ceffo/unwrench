# Ralph Progress Log

This file tracks progress across iterations. Agents update this file
after each iteration and it's included in prompts for context.

## Codebase Patterns (Study These First)

- **No bundler**: All JS is vanilla ES modules loaded directly by Chrome. `import` paths must be relative (e.g. `./selectors.js`), not bare specifiers.
- **Page-context injection**: `apiInterceptor.js` creates a `<script>` element and immediately removes it — the only way to wrap `window.fetch` in the page context from a content script.
- **Pure modules for testing**: `gitattributesParser.js` and `fileMatcher.js` have zero browser/DOM imports so they can be `node --test`ed directly.
- **Single selector file**: All GitLab DOM selectors live exclusively in `src/content/selectors.js` — never inline them in other modules.
- **chrome.storage.session** (not `localStorage`) for per-session `.gitattributes` cache — survives tab navigations but clears on browser restart.

## 2026-04-26 - unw-0bz.1
- What was implemented: Full project scaffold — manifest.json (MV3), all 11 content script modules, popup (HTML/JS/CSS), background service worker, 3 placeholder PNG icons, README.md skeleton.
- Files changed: `manifest.json`, `src/background.js`, `src/content/index.js`, `mrContext.js`, `apiInterceptor.js`, `gitattributesLoader.js`, `gitattributesParser.js`, `fileMatcher.js`, `iconInjector.js`, `fileHider.js`, `viewedMarker.js`, `observer.js`, `selectors.js`, `src/popup/popup.html`, `popup.js`, `popup.css`, `icons/icon{16,48,128}.png`, `README.md`
- **Learnings:**
  - MV3 background service worker cannot use `chrome.tabs` without the `tabs` permission — used `tabs` query in background only to relay storage changes; check if `tabs` permission is needed at manifest level (currently not declared — will need to add if background tab relay is required).
  - PNG icons must be valid binary PNG; generated programmatically with Python/zlib since no image editor available in this env.
  - `br sync --flush-only` reported "nothing to export" after `br close` — likely because the close already wrote to JSONL. This is normal.

## 2026-04-26 - unw-0bz.3
- What was implemented: Rewrote `src/content/mrContext.js` with async `getMRContext()` returning `{ projectId, sourceBranch, mrIid, mrPath, sourceSha }`. Extraction priority: `window.gl` global → `<meta>` tags / `document.body.dataset` → REST API fallback (`/api/v4/projects/:id/merge_requests/:iid`). Returns `null` on non-MR pages. `fetchMRMeta` kept as named export for reuse.
- Files changed: `src/content/mrContext.js`
- **Learnings:**
  - GitLab's `gl` global uses `gl.mrMetadata.sourceBranch` and `gl.mrMetadata.headSha` (not `gl.mr.*`) on newer versions — try both for resilience.
  - `mrPath` needed for the localStorage key format: `code-review-<mrPath>` (§5.5).
  - `sourceSha` can be null when API fallback also fails — callers must handle this gracefully.
  - The scaffold was synchronous and missing `mrPath`/`sourceSha`; always check scaffold completeness against bead spec before skipping to close.

## 2026-04-26 - unw-0bz.4
- What was implemented: `apiInterceptor.js` (complete) with `injectFetchInterceptor()` (idempotent via `window.__GL_FETCH_INTERCEPTED__` sentinel) and `waitForDiffsMetadata()` returning a Promise. Added `interceptorBootstrap.js` — a non-module content script at `document_start` that injects the fetch wrapper before GitLab's Vue app runs (EC-07). Fixed `manifest.json` to declare `"type": "module"` for the `index.js` content script entry (required for ES module `import` syntax in content scripts).
- Files changed: `src/content/apiInterceptor.js`, `src/content/interceptorBootstrap.js` (new), `manifest.json`
- **Learnings:**
  - Chrome MV3 content scripts with `import` statements require `"type": "module"` in the manifest `content_scripts` entry — without it, the browser rejects the script with a SyntaxError. The scaffold omitted this.
  - `run_at: "document_start"` does **not** support `"type": "module"` in Chrome MV3. The bootstrap must be a plain IIFE-in-a-string injected via a `<script>` tag, not an ES module.
  - Use a sentinel flag (`window.__GL_FETCH_INTERCEPTED__`) on the page context `window` to prevent double-wrapping when both the bootstrap and the fallback `injectFetchInterceptor()` might run.
  - `postMessage` origin filter: always pass `"*"` as the targetOrigin when posting from page context to content script — the content script checks `event.source === window` instead.

## 2026-04-26 - unw-0bz.5
- What was implemented: `src/content/gitattributesLoader.js` — `loadGitattributes(projectId, ref, sha)` async function. Checks `chrome.storage.session` cache (key: `ga_cache_<projectId>_<sha>`), falls back to recursive tree discovery + content fetch. Follows `X-Next-Page` pagination up to 5000 entries. Batches content fetches 10 at a time. 404 on root `.gitattributes` silently no-ops; other errors log to console.
- Files changed: `src/content/gitattributesLoader.js` (already implemented in scaffold; verified complete)
- **Learnings:**
  - Implementation was already present from the unw-0bz.1 scaffold and required no changes — always verify scaffold completeness before starting implementation work.
  - NFR-04 (max 10 concurrent) and NFR-05 (max 1 req/sec) are contradictory as stated; the implementation satisfies NFR-04 via batch chunking. Sequential tree pagination naturally rate-limits tree discovery; file content fetches are batched (10 at once).
  - `chrome.storage.session` does not persist across browser restarts, making it ideal for per-session API response caching.
  - Cache key uses `_` separator (`projectId_sha`) not `:` — avoid `:` in storage keys to prevent confusion with URL colons.

## 2026-04-26 - unw-0bz.6
- What was implemented: `src/content/gitattributesParser.test.js` — 12 Node built-in `node:test` unit tests for `parseGitattributes` and `parseAllGitattributes`. Scaffold parser was already correct; no changes to `gitattributesParser.js` needed.
- Files changed: `src/content/gitattributesParser.test.js` (new)
- **Learnings:**
  - Scaffold's argument order (`content, directory`) differs from bead spec (`path, content`) — the scaffold is internally consistent (called only via `parseAllGitattributes` which derives `directory` from `path`), so no change required.
  - Node `node:test` + `node:assert/strict` works with ES module imports (`import`) as long as the file is `.js` and node is 18+. No config needed.
  - `parseAllGitattributes` derives `directory` by slicing everything before the last `/` in `path`; root `.gitattributes` (no slash) correctly yields `''`.

## 2026-04-26 - unw-0bz.2
- What was implemented: Rewrote `src/content/selectors.js` with named exports verified against GitLab 17.x open-source Vue components. Added an exported convenience `SELECTORS` object for backward compat with existing modules.
- Files changed: `src/content/selectors.js`
- **Learnings:**
  - GitLab's confirmed class names (from live source): `.diff-file-row` (tree row), `.file-row-name` (filename in tree), `.tree-list-holder` (tree container), `.js-file-title` (diff header), `.file-header-content .file-title-name` (filename in header), `.diff-file` (full block), `#diffs` (root container).
  - GitLab also exposes `data-testid` attributes (`file-title-container`, `file-name-content`) which are more stable; documented in selector comments but not used as primary selectors to keep queries simple.
  - Fetching GitLab raw Vue source at `gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/raw/master/...` works without auth for public files.
  - All consumers use `SELECTORS.*` via the convenience object — no import changes needed.
